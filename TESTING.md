## Validator Testing
### W3C HTML

Technique used for validating html in production site (heroku): 

Navigate to a page in Chrome / Chrome Inspect mode / View Page Source / Copy html / Paste to W3C html validator - direct input.

* __Info Messages__

There are html validator messages regarding trailing slash endings as  self-closing tags for the void elements. These are neither errors nor warnings. This issue has been widely covered throughout developer communities. It is said that trailing slashes may cause issues with unquoted attribute values, whereas self-closing tags are required in XHTML ([Mdn reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element)). 

I do not use unquoted attribute values, and I confirmed that these kinds of tags do not cause any bugs.

### W3C CSS
I use 5 CSS files to serve web-pages in my applications. 

- `style.css` - accessible across all applications
- `profile.css` - serving User profile pages
- `playlist_update.css` - serving User Playlist management pages
- `core_styles` - serving Home page and Playlist Detail pages (accessible for non-logged in users)
- `base_allauth.css` - custom restyling of django-allauth pages. 

__Explanation of Errors Revealed in Validator Results:__

All of the parse errors reported by W3C CSS validator are related to 'CSS nested rules', which the validator does not yet support, the 'nested CSS' syntax being a relatively new feature. The issue has been discussed in a number of places, particularly on GitHub issues , Reddit and some other less popular blogs.

It is acknowledged that such approach as CSS nesting reduces redundancy and simplifies the management of complex styles, leading to cleaner and more organized code. Additionally, CSS nesting aligns with the principles of modular design, which is especially in demand for complex and large-scale projects.
Moreover, CSS nesting is supported by all major modern browsers: 

| Browser Name: | Full support from: | Version released in: |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Chrome | version 120 | released in 2023 |
| Edge | version 120 | released in 2023 |
| Firefox | version 117 | released in 2023 |
| Safari | version 17.2 | released in 2023 |
| Opera | version 106 | released in 2023 |
| Chrome for Android | version 125 | released in 2024 |
| Safari on iOS | version 17.2 | released in 2023 |
| Samsung Internet | version 25 | released in 2024 |
| Opera Mobile | version 80 | released in 2023 |
| Firefox for Android | version 126 | released in 2024 |

[Link to 'Can I Use' reg Nesting Selector](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_nesting)

[Using CSS Nesting Selector MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting)

In order to avoid ambiguities and ensure that styles are applied as intended across different browsers I used `&` nesting selector. It is said that using the `&` nesting selector helps prevent issues with compound selectors and pseudo-classes, which can be sensitive to whitespace and other syntactical nuances

[MDN '&' Nesting selector uses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Nesting_at-rules)

__A note on "undefined variable" warning in user_profile.js__

In fact, it is dynamically defined inside a template because external .js files do not support Django template language.

This is the snippet from `profile.html`:

~~~
{% endblock main_content %}

{% block bottom %}
<script>
    var profileUrl = '{% url "profile" %}';
</script>
<script src="{% static 'js/user-profile.js' %}"></script>
{% endblock %}
~~~

### Python Linter
I used the validator provided by the Code Institute [here](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).


I have checked all python-based files on PEP8 integrity and can guarantee that there are no errors found, with one exception. These are commonly known lines in Django settings:
~~~
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",
    },
]
~~~

I left them unscathed for better readability. After all, according to [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds".

As far as there are too many python files in the project I do not deliver screenshots of successful tests here.

## Lighthouse

![Landing Page - the largest one](documentation/validator_slides/lighthouse-largest-page.png)

- Performance 85% is not so good because of the 'Largest Contentful Paint' which takes most of time delay. I do not dare to reduce quality to the worse anymore.
- Best practices ranked 78% due to cookies coming from images imposed by Cloudinary.  

However, in comparison to Slipknot original home site it is much better.

## BUGS

In fact, there were so many bugs in this project to overcome that I am not sure how to filter them through. Mostly they were not so much bugs but rather attributes of taming and mastering this complex framework. 

1. APPLICATION CRASH AFTER INSTALLING DJANGO-ALLAUTH. SITE_ID PROBLEM.

After installation and configuring Django-allauth and setting localhost and heroku domains in admin console the server crashed without even usual Django debug error notifications. I could not start server and could not get access to admin console. Long plunge into the problem hinted that something was wrong with SITE_ID setting. 

In the result of try and error method I change the setting for SIT_ID to 2. It worked suddenly for me.
Then after a while I tested e-mail verifications and noticed that django-allauth sent messages on behalf of localhost. So I revisited the issue with SITE_ID value.

It appeared that when I manipulated with domains I unintentionally deleted the default domain and thus leaving ID=1 empty, NULL. I checked through Django shell IDs of existing domains. They appeared to be id=2 for localhost and id=3 for Heroku.

**Solution.** SITE_ID for production environment is set to 3 associated with production domain on Heroku.

2. CONTEXT CONFUSION BETWEEN USER 1 WATCHING PROFILE PRESENTATION OF USER 2

- User navigation flow. Problem description.


Suppose User 1 is watching the site. User 1 picks up a playlist shared by User 2 defined by context and by the database schema as `author` of that Playlist.

User 1 decides to have a look to the User's 2 profile and playlists. User 1 clicks on User's 2 avatar and gets to User profile presentation page. URL is not flawed and reveals the page of User 2.

However, on the header User 1 can see the greeting 'Hello, User 2', which is not good enough.

- Understanding the problem

I have set 2 navigation bars: for authenticated user and for non-authenticated user
~~~
{% if not user.is_authenticated %}
{% include 'core/navbar-signup.html' %}
{% else %}
{% include 'core/navbar-signed.html' %}
{% endif %}
~~~

`navbar-signed.html` displays a greeting to an authenticated user calling a name from the variable `{{ user.username }}`. That is the problem. 

When User 1 initiates URL leading to the profile of User 2, i.e. `'/presentation/user2/'` my navbar logic captures `user2` from url and greets User 2 that might confuse User 1.

**Solution** 

a) Set an explicit and robust context for user2 as an `author` of a playlist in contrast to User 1 as a current user.
~~~
user_profile = get_object_or_404(UserProfile.objects.select_related('user')user__username=username)
profile_user = user_profile.user
~~~
`user_profile` is an instance of the UserProfile model\
`profile_user` is a value of `username` field of User model One-to-One related to UserProfile model)\
In our case study `profile_user` is User 2.

b) set a variable calling a name of active and authenticated site User in navbar : `{{ request.user.username }}` as opposed to `user.username` using context processors `django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth`. Thus we separate contexts entirely to avoid confusions.
