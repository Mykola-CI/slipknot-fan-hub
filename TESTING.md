## Validator Testing
### W3C HTML

Technique used for validating html in production site (heroku): 

Navigate to a page in Chrome / Chrome Inspect mode / View Page Source / Copy html / Paste to W3C html validator - direct input.

* __Info Messages__

There are html validator messages regarding trailing slash endings as  self-closing tags for the void elements. These are neither errors nor warnings. This issue has been widely covered throughout developer communities. It is said that trailing slashes may cause issues with unquoted attribute values, whereas self-closing tags are required in XHTML ([Mdn reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element)). 

I do not use unquoted attribute values, and I confirmed that these kinds of tags do not cause any bugs.

### W3C CSS
I use 5 CSS files to serve web-pages in all applications. 

- `style.css` - accessible across all applications
- `profile.css` - serving User profile pages
- `playlist_update.css` - serving User Playlist management pages
- `core_styles` - serving Home page and Playlist Detail pages (accessible for non-logged in users)
- `base_allauth.css` - custom restyling of django-allauth pages. 

__Explanation of Errors Revealed in Validator Results:__

All of the parse errors reported by W3C CSS validator are related to 'CSS nested rules', which the validator does not yet support, the 'nested CSS' syntax being a relatively new feature. The issue has been discussed in a number of places, particularly on GitHub issues , Reddit and some other less popular blogs.

It is acknowledged that such approach as CSS nesting reduces redundancy and simplifies the management of complex styles, leading to cleaner and more organized code. Additionally, CSS nesting aligns with the principles of modular design, which is especially in demand for complex and large-scale projects.
Moreover, CSS nesting is supported by all major modern browsers: 

| Browser Name: | Full support from: | Version released in: |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Chrome | version 120 | released in 2023 |
| Edge | version 120 | released in 2023 |
| Firefox | version 117 | released in 2023 |
| Safari | version 17.2 | released in 2023 |
| Opera | version 106 | released in 2023 |
| Chrome for Android | version 125 | released in 2024 |
| Safari on iOS | version 17.2 | released in 2023 |
| Samsung Internet | version 25 | released in 2024 |
| Opera Mobile | version 80 | released in 2023 |
| Firefox for Android | version 126 | released in 2024 |

[Using CSS Nesting Selector MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting)

In order to avoid ambiguities and ensure that styles are applied as intended across different browsers I used `&` nesting selector. It is said that using the `&` nesting selector helps prevent issues with compound selectors and pseudo-classes, which can be sensitive to whitespace and other syntactical nuances

[MDN '&' Nesting selector uses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Nesting_at-rules)

__A note on "undefined variable" warning in user_profile.js__

In fact, it is dynamically defined inside a template because external .js files do not support Django template language.

This is the snippet from `profile.html`:

~~~
{% endblock main_content %}

{% block bottom %}
<script>
    var profileUrl = '{% url "profile" %}';
</script>
<script src="{% static 'js/user-profile.js' %}"></script>
{% endblock %}
~~~

### Python Linter
I used the validator provided by the Code Institute [here](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).


I have checked all python-based files on PEP8 integrity and can guarantee that there are no errors found, with one exception. These are commonly known lines in Django settings:
~~~
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",
    },
]
~~~

I left them unscathed for better readability. After all, according to [PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds".

As far as there are too many python files in the project I do not deliver screenshots of successful tests here.


## Manual Testing
### SignUp and Login.



## Django Unit Testing

Due to the pressing deadline and the substantial number of files, I focused on the most complex test cases. This approach aimed to augment and enhance the outcomes of manual testing rather than duplicate the more obvious scenarios.

### User Profile AJAX-based View.
- __Testing form rendering__

| Test name | Goals |
| --- | --- |
| test_get_email_form | Checking the presence of the mock email address and the label title in the response content |
